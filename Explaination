First, we define a function RK that takes in the arguments f (the function to integrate), x0 (the initial value), tspan (the range of time values to integrate over), and h (the step size).

Next, we define a few variables:

t is initialized to the starting time value tspan[1].
x is initialized to the initial value x0.
n is the number of steps that will be taken during the integration. It is calculated by dividing the range of time values by the step size, rounding up to the nearest integer, and converting to an integer type.
k is a matrix that will hold the intermediate values of the function f calculated during each step of the integration.
Then, I loop over n steps. Inside the loop, we first calculate the six intermediate values of f using the formulas given in the paper. These values are stored in the columns of the k matrix.

Next, we update the value of x using a weighted sum of these intermediate values, where the weights are given by the c and b coefficients defined in the Butcher table for the chosen Runge-Kutta method. The specific coefficients used in this code correspond to the sixth-order accurate Runge-Kutta method described in the paper.

Finally, we update the value of t and store the new value of x in an array sol. This array will hold the solution values for x at each time step.

After the loop is complete, we return the sol array. This array contains the numerical solution to the differential equation.
